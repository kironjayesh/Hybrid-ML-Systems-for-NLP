# Hybrid-ML-Systems-for-NLP
Let us take a sentiment analysis problem and look at how hybrid machine learning systems affect the accuracy of the model.
The dataset contains tweets that talk about the problems of six different major US airlines. Our aim is to train a model to categorize the tweets into positive, negative, and neutral in sentiment. We will use a hybrid machine learning system that uses Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines Classification to achieve the expected result.
